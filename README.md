Science Fair Project

Basically, this is a note recognition tool. Its purpose is to be used by a teacher on one end and a student on the other simultaneously during online/distance learning. 

The HTML code is for the webpages, and Arduino code is for the microcontroller which is to be used alongside the site. 
  The microcontroller I am using is the ESP8266MOD hooked up to a breadboard with button inputs as it has WiFi capability and can communicate with a website.

Each webpage is given separately to show the steps of user interaction. There is a "website" page which is supposed to combine the different webpages into a functioning website.
